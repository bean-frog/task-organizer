## Super simple task organizer for school or whatever
most of this was made while tired so the code is terrible
### features:
- automatically saves in browser 
- shows percent completion
- custom icon/border color for each task
- probably some other cool stuff

### problems:
- reloads page to fully clear tasks (hacky fix but it works)
- atrocious amount of vertical spacing. i tried for ~45 min to fix but idk why its there still
- no dark mode (yet)
- doesnt save checkbox state
